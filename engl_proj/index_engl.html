          The model analyzed in this card uses characteristics about
          a movie to predict whether a movie passes the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank">Bechdel test</a>.
          In short, the Bechdel test is a set of questions that can be asked about a
          form of media to measure the representation of women. The model's
          goal is to offer another method of using the Bechdel test for
          discussions surrounding the representation of women in media.
          The model's goal is <span class="bolded">not</span> to determine whether a form of media is
          “feminist” or not as this idea is unfaithful to the original goal of
          being a “cultural barometer” of female representation.

        <p class="body-text">
          There are several versions of the Bechdel test, however, the version
          the data the model is trained on is relatively simple. The test
          essentially asks the following three questions.
          <ol>
            <li>Does it have at least two [named] women in it?</li>
            <li>Do the women talk to each other?</li>
            <li>Do they talk about something besides a man?</li>
          </ol>

          On this page, you can learn more about the inner workings of the
          model as well as how effectively it performs.

              The overall model performance is measured using the mean squared
              error. This error is calculated for both the data the model is
              trained on as well as the data the model is tested on. For the
              model, a sweet-spot is chosen to avoid overfitting or
              underfitting the data (see the trade offs section for
              details).

        <p>
          When developing machine learning models, there is a Goldilocks zone
          that is aimed for. This Goldilocks zone is a trade-off between bias
          and variance or overfitting and underfitting. Essentially, the model
          is built with the idea that it should not work so well on the data it
          is trained on so that it is useless in real world scenarios but it
          should also not be so varied that it fails to accurately classify the
          data it trained on. Using performance metrics, a balance was struck
          between these two concepts in an effort to create a model capable of
          accurately classifying the data it trained on while remaining useful
          in new scenarios.

          This model uses mean squared error (MSE) as its performance metric.
          MSE is a calculation derived from finding the difference between the
          model's predictions and the actual results, squaring this value, and
          then calculating the mean of these squares. This metric is then used
          to compare the effects of changing different hyperparameters of the
          decision tree such as the max tree depth of the max number
          of features.
