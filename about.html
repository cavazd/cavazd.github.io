          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I am a graduating senior at the University of Washington (UW)
            iSchool studying Informatics with a focus in Data Science. To me,
            Informatics is a field of study that allows for a focus on both STEM
            driven topics and humanities driven topics. What this means for my
            focus in Data Science is I have the opportunity to learn technical
            skills such as linear regression and machine learning models while
            simultaneously learning about concepts such as data ethics and
            data privacy.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            This unique perspective on Data Science has reshaped my approach to
            key topics such as exploratory data analysis, linear regression,
            and data visualization which I bring with me to my current and
            future projects.

          <h2>Elective Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a student at the UW iSchool, I am lucky to be able to take
            elective courses to expand my knowledge beyond my graduation
            requirements. For example, to learn more about Data Science theory,
            I took the class Applied Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis where
            I learned about important concepts such as principal component
            analysis. I also took the class Professional and Technical Writing
            where I strengthened my ability to write technical reports and
            translate technical jargon into a more consumable format.

          <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
          <p>
            For my most recent personal project, I wanted to create a
            visualization related to one of my favorite hobbies, the Rocket
            League esports scene. Rocket League is a 3v3 team game simulating
            soccer, however, instead of playing as a human, you control a
            rocket-powered car. In the competitive scene, the top teams from
            each region are invited to international events periodically. As it
            stands, the current visualizations for team rankings by region make
            it difficult for users to see teamsâ€™ growth and failures over the
            course of the year long season. Noticing this opportunity, I
            conducted a short task and stakeholder analysis to create a rough
            draft of a visualization designed to fill this gap. Once satisfied
            with a bump chart design, I began scrapping the data online using
            the Python package Beautiful Soup. After scrapping the data, I used
            R and related tidyverse packages to clean and organize the data.
            With the cleaned data, I used JavaScript (D3.js) to create the bump
            chart showing the Rocket League Championship Series rankings for the
            2021-2022 season. One interesting insight visualized with this
            chart, is the rise of Oxygen Esports in North America. Hovering
            over this team, we can see they start the season with 0 points
            ranked 24th but end the season with 1,110 points ranked 8th in
            their region, showing the team became more competitive towards
            the latter half of the season.

          <h2>Goals For the Future</h2>
          <p>
            My goals after graduation include using the skills I have learned
            in class and through personal projects while continuing to expand
            my knowledge surrounding these topics in the field of Data Science
            and Data Analytics.  Additionally, I want the opportunity to use
            industry technologies such as JupyterLabs and Tableau to make
            meaningful and important insights through data. Finally, I am
            looking forward to working with people with diverse backgrounds
            and skillsets at a company that encourages improvement and growth.
